        <h2>INITIAL INTERACTIONS</h2>
        <section class="section-box">
        <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>Overall, the first thing that caught my eye when interacting with Tetrageddon was the chaotic nature. It seems to overwhelm the user by displaying multiple pop-ups that cannot be closed, while also redirecting the user to multiple other parts of the page, furhter expanding its interactivity.</p>
        <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking X's</li>
                <li>Highlighting text</li>
                <li>Closing pop-up tabs</li>
                <li>Turning volume down</li>
                <li>Muting audio that auto-plays</li>
                <li>Typing into textboxes</li>
                <li>Dragging elements</li>
                <li>Trying to click fast moving elements (cookies)</li>
                <li>Filling out fake survey</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>Towards the end of the two minutes, I ended up on a page with a type of interactive puzzle, which I spent the remainder of the time trying to figure out how to unlock a certain link in order to see further into the site.</p>
        <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p>The most common action I made was clicking the X on all the different pop-ups that were flashing on screen, especially at the beginning of the experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-box">
        <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p>It seems the intended goal is to overwhelm/scare the user initially. Once experienced, the user can reflect on all the jokes/messages to conclude on the intention of the site, which I believe to be a collage of internet culture to represent the impact the internet can have on people.</p>
        <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
        <p>Using internet culture, puns and jokes, the site attempts to (although forcfily) guide the user through different stages of internet culture, using a very confronting and chaotic visual.</p>
        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>In my eyes, it seems that this site is meant to be experienced once, and then spread amongst friends and family as almost a gimick, while still spreading its message.</p>
        <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>When interacting with the site, anytime the user tries to close out of any of the prompts, or select a choice that would end an interaction, the user is forced to choose the opposing choice, forcing them to continue the experience. Since this occurs with pretty much every activity on the site, it forces the user to "relinquish" control to the site, forcing them to experience what it has to offer.</p>

        <h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>
        <section class="section-box">
            <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
            <p>Tetragreddon seems to be exaggerating and mocking common internet culture. A big refernece it seems to pull from is the common fear of your computer being invaded/hacked, which is referenced and exaggerated through almost every section of the site. Every warning includes some type of joke/humour, which seem to be in relation to inernet memes and culture, which is another reference they are pulling from.</p>
            <h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
            <p>I believe the use of internet culture and memes being intergrated into the site allows the user to have some type of connection with the site, whether thats from previous negative experiences or knowledge about the culture. Some people may act out of fear by falling for its tricks, while others may embrace internet journey it brings you through.</p>
            <h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>
            <p>I believe Tetrageddon attempts to appeal/attract two types of people. One group being those who may initially fear the site due to its chaotic nature, and the other being a humoured group who interact with each element to experience a visual depiction of internet culture that they would have experienced.</p>
            <h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
            <p>The most frustrating element of this site is the constant in browser pop ups that occur when interacting with different buttons on the site. When these notifactions appear, you can no longer use the site until you close the pop-up, which can get quite frustrating especially with how often they occur.</p>
            <h3>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3>
            <p>The most satisfying element to me with Tetrageddon is the responsiveness of the desktop puzzle that is included within the site. This puzzle allows you to take control of a virutal computer, which is very engaging as you are usually going to be accessing this site through your own PC. This makes the experience immersive, and allows the puzzle to become very satisfying to solve.</p>
